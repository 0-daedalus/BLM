# BLM
NFactorial entrance task

To launch the program, you need to run an executable .jar file. There are 2 main ways to do that. You can double click on the file and choose “Java Runtime Environment” as the tool to launch it, or you can go to the command prompt or terminal, navigate to the directory that contains the .jar file and run command:
	java –jar BLM.jar
IN CASE THE ABOVE METHODS DO NOT WORK:
In case something goes wrong you will need to extract and open the source files and launch the program from a Java IDE (for example IntelliJ IDEA) by building and running the source code itself. Sry for the inconvenience.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When you launch the program, you will see the GUI appear. This is my first attempt in making a GUI in Java, so don’t judge too harshly. Press on the “Choose file” button and choose a VALID .txt file from which you want to extract the bigrams. After doing it, you may press any of the remaining 2 buttons: “Generate Name” to generate a random name from all of the bigrams or “Generate Table” to open a window with a graphic representation of the probabilities of each bigram being chosen. To close the program, simply close the GUI using the cross button in the upper-right corner.
